                <p class="experienceInfo">Working in the second-year laboratory sessions helping to teach and guide students through the scripts I had helped develop.  This model of teaching was taken up after I noticed that there was a shortage of PhD students to demonstrate and suggested that final year students could fill the gap.  I am extremely proud as this model was such a success that it has been duplicated this year, with a second cohort are being invited to participate.</p>

                <p class="experienceInfo">My lab partner and I helped develop scripts and code to integrate Arduinos into the second-year electronics lab sessions, since the students were yet to learn C, we used Firmata (which in simple terms translates python to C and vice versa).  We also had to figure how to include Arduinos into some of the second-year projects.  I went from not having much experience at all with Arduinos to building circuits for data collection from a sensor.  We also researched and gained an understanding of how other departments use Arduinos or how they would like to incorporate them into their teaching in the future.</p>

            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>At university, I joined the gym which I try to attend often with my friends as we help motivate each other and is a good way to keep mentally and physically fit.  I often go walking outdoors especially with my dog.  I enjoy being creative and innovative and express it in my art.  I also hold an UK driving licence. </p>
